# Passive Information Gathering

This type of information is basically gathered through publicly available sources, or prominently without actively engaging with the target.

***
Generally, following entities are gathered while performing Passive reconnaissance:
1. IP addresses 
2. DNS information - Domain names and ownership info.
3. E-mail addresses and social media profiles
4. Web technology used on target sites
5. Sub-domains
6. Physical addresses / Phone numbers
7. Directories hidden from the search engines
