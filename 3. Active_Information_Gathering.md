# Active Information Gathering

Active information gathering involves contact between the pen tester and the actual target.

For example, if you use Nmap to find open ports and applications on a desired remote system, you are actively interacting with that system in an attempt to find weaknesses
***

Active information gathering includes (not limited to) the following:
1. Discovering open ports on target systems
2. Learn about internal infrastructure of a network or organisation without a formal permission.
3. Enumerating inofrmation from the target systems.

## DNS
* DNS = Domain Name System is a protocol to resolve domain names/ hostnames to IP addresses.
* DNS server (nameserver) = Like a telephone directory that contains domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.

### DNS Records
1. A - Resolves hostname/ domain to an IPv4 address
2. AAAA - Resolves hostname to an IPv6 address
3. NS - Reference to the domain's nameserver
4. MX - Resolves a domain to a mail server
5. CNAME - USed for domain aliases
6. TXT - Text record
7. HINFO - Host INformation
8. SOA - Domain authority
9. SRV - Service records
10. PTR - Reesolves an IP address to a hostname

### DNS Interrogation
It is the process of enumerating DNS records for a specific domain.
Objective =  Probe a DNS server to provide us with DNS records for a specific domain

### DNS Zone transfer
* Primary DNs server = holds the master copy of DNs record
* Secondary DNS server = holds the redundant copy of DNS record
* The process through which a primary DNS server copy or transfer zone files to another DNS server is known as a Zone Transfer.
* If misconfigured or left unsecured, this functionality can ve abused by attackers.
* Before reaching DNS, we can use the host file stored on almost every OS. In LINUX, it can be fetched usingthe vim command `sudo vim /etc/hosts `

` dnsenum zonetransfer.me `

` fierce --domain [URL] `

## Host discovery with nmap (Network Mapper)

To find the systems or hosts on the network that we are connected to.

* Find your IP: ` ip a s `
* nmap using -sn option = No port scan

` sudo nmap -sn [IP address discovered in the last step] `

* netdiscover tool also provide the similar utility
  ` sudo apt-get install netdiscover -y `
  
  ` sudo netdiscover -i [Interface-name] -r [network range/sub-domain IP] `

  Eg: ` sudo netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.2.0/24 `

## Port scanning with nmap 

### TCP ports' scan

* ` nmap [IP] ` Default nmap scan will run a SYN stealth scan on 1000 of the most frequently used ports. Not scanning the entire range of TCP ports on the target system. (what is SYN stealth scan?)
*  Windows systems will typically block ICMP pings or ping probes. This can be ignored using -Pn option:
  ` nmap -Pn [IP] `
* Fast scan can be done using -F option to scan most commonly used 100 ports:
  ` nmap -Pn -F [IP]
*  Tp perform nmap scan on all the TCP ports (about 65,535), -p- option can be used:
  ` nmap -Pn -p- [IP] `
* To scan a particular port:
  ` nmap -Pn -p [portnumber 1, portnumber 2, ....] [IP] `
* To scan a range:
  ` nmap -Pn -p [starting port number] - [ending port number] [IP] `
* Types of status of the ports: Open, Closed, Filtered (this means this port is used by some web server or HTTP proxy)
* To know the details of the scan while scanning is going on use verbose option -v:
  ` nmap -Pn [IP] -v `

### UDP ports' scan
` nmap -Pn -sU [IP] `

### Service version detection scan
* use -sV option:
  ` nmap -Pn -sV -F [IP] `

### Predict the OS 
* use -O option:
  ` nmap -Pn -F -O [IP] -v `

### Script scan
* operates just on open ports
* Find out more about this ???

### Aggressive scan
* Combines -sV -O -sC together using -A option

### Control time of scan
* use -T(1-5) : higher the faster.

### Import scan results
* - oN [file name] : in the same way the results are displayed on the terminal
  ` nmap -sV  -Pn -F [IP] -oN [file_name].txt
* Another way: XML format:  -oX [file_name].xml
