# Active Information Gathering

Active information gathering involves contact between the pen tester and the actual target.

For example, if you use Nmap to find open ports and applications on a desired remote system, you are actively interacting with that system in an attempt to find weaknesses
***

Active information gathering includes (not limited to) the following:
1. Discovering open ports on target systems
2. Learn about internal infrastructure of a network or organisation without a formal permission.
3. Enumerating inofrmation from the target systems.

## DNS
* DNS = Domain Name System is a protocol to resolve domain names/ hostnames to IP addresses.
* DNS server (nameserver) = Like a telephone directory that contains domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.

### DNS Records
1. A - Resolves hostname/ domain to an IPv4 address
2. AAAA - Resolves hostname to an IPv6 address
3. NS - Reference to the domain's nameserver
4. MX - Resolves a domain to a mail server
5. CNAME - USed for domain aliases
6. TXT - Text record
7. HINFO - Host INformation
8. SOA - Domain authority
9. SRV - Service records
10. PTR - Reesolves an IP address to a hostname

### DNS Interrogation
It is the process of enumerating DNS records for a specific domain.
Objective =  Probe a DNS server to provide us with DNS records for a specific domain

### DNS Zone transfer
* Primary DNs server = holds the master copy of DNs record
* Secondary DNS server = holds the redundant copy of DNS record
* The process through which a primary DNS server copy or transfer zone files to another DNS server is known as a Zone Transfer.
* If misconfigured or left unsecured, this functionality can ve abused by attackers.
* Before reaching DNS, we can use the host file stored on almost every OS. In LINUX, it can be fetched usingthe vim command `sudo vim /etc/hosts `

` dnsenum zonetransfer.me `

` fierce --domain [URL] `
